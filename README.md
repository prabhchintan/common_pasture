# Common Pastures Game: Seeing Like a State

Welcome to the extended Common Pastures Game! This interactive game, built using ReactJS, first positions you as a shepherd sharing a common pasture with a virtual neighbor. In the second part, you evolve into the role of the governor of the state. The game integrates the dynamics of the classic "Prisoner's Dilemma" and the principles of "Seeing Like a State", offering a rich blend of choice, strategy, and governance that's both entertaining and thought-provoking.

## Gameplay

**Part One: The Shepherd**

Each day, you have a decision to make: let your sheep graze in the common pasture or your private farm. But remember! The grass in the common pasture is finite. If both you and your neighbor choose to graze there excessively, the grass won't regenerate. The challenge is to maximize your happiness score, which is influenced by your daily choices and your neighbor's decisions.

**Part Two: The Governor**

In the second part, you step into the role of a governor. You have the power to influence the choices of the farmers. Your options are to do nothing, survey the pasture, extract resources, or collect taxes. Each choice impacts both the farmers and the state. Here, the challenge is to balance the interests of the state and the farmers, considering the dynamics of power and spontaneous order.

The game lasts for a week in the first part, and for a year in the second part. Throughout these periods, you'll have opportunities to reflect on your choices, their outcomes, and the strategies you adopted.

## Learning Outcomes

The game offers a fun and interactive way to explore key concepts in game theory and political science. These include the Prisoner's Dilemma, the tragedy of the commons, dynamics of power, principles of spontaneous order, and much more. It encourages players to think critically about decision-making, strategy, and the intricate dynamics between individuals and institutions.
